This Group Expense Tracker website falls in the Finance Category and serves the important purpose of managing finances which is a very important part of one’s life. 
This allows multiple or single users to maintain a digital automated diary. 
This website helps to track the expenses and savings when people go on trips ,parties, get togathers ..etc. 
Tracking expenses daily can really help to us save a lot of money.
Once we start off by tracking our expenses day by day, we will be able to get a better idea where you are spending your money, so you stay in control and achieve your goal. 
If you are on a trip with friends or planning a picnic or party with co-workers, it is possible that someone will be paying the taxi bills while others are left for paying for drinks or hotel costs. But you need to track all of these expenses and finally split the cost among the participants without ending up with a mess. 
By using the group expense tracker you can efficiently manage all costs per individual, track ‘who paid how much’ and ‘who should pay to whom’. 
So this expense tracker keeps you informed about who spend how much and who owns how much to the other . 
Potential scenarios include paying rent, splitting a check at dinner, sharing travel expenses, etc. It helps the user to save a lot of money and time.
